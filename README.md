# Mirror (V0.10.2)

<img src="./icon.svg" width="128" height="128" alt="mirror-icon" align="right" onerror="this.style.display='none'"/>

This application is a GNOME Shell extension that serves as a native frontend for [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy). It allows you to effortlessly mirror and control your Android devices directly from the GNOME Quick Settings menu. It is specially designed to leverage `avahi` and `adb` to auto-discover devices with wireless debugging enabled.

<img src="./showcase.png" alt="mirror-showcase" align="center" onerror="this.style.display='none'"/>

It focuses on:

 - **integration**: acts as a native Quick Settings toggle in the GNOME panel
 - **convenience**: automatically discovers both USB and wireless devices via mDNS
 - **performance**: relies on the powerful, low-latency `scrcpy` backend
 - **non-intrusiveness**: a clean, minimal addition to your system menu with a built-in loading spinner
 - **freedom**: free, unencumbered software released into the public domain

Its features include:
 - one-click device mirroring directly from the Quick Settings menu
 - automatic discovery of Android 11+ wireless debugging devices on your network
 - automatic `adb connect` execution for wireless devices
 - seamless pairing with QR 
 - customization through settings panel

## Prerequisites

Because this extension acts as a graphical wrapper, it requires the core dependencies to be installed on your Linux system and accessible in your `PATH`:

1. **GNOME Shell:** Version 46, 47, 48, 49 or 50.
2. **`scrcpy`:** For handling the actual video/audio mirroring and control.
3. **`adb` (Android Debug Bridge):** For managing the device connections and fetching statuses.
4. **`avahi-browse`:** For discovering wireless devices on your local network (usually provided by the `avahi-utils` or `avahi` package depending on your distro).
5. **`qrencode`:** For generating the QR code for seamless pairing.

Make sure you have [enabled USB debugging](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#enable) or Wireless Debugging on your Android device(s).

## Get the extension

 - **GNOME Extensions Website:** [Download from extensions.gnome.org] *https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/9053/mirror/*
 - **Manual Installation:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/TheRealSourcer/mirror.git](https://github.com/TheRealSourcer/mirror.git)
   # Copy the extension folder to your local GNOME extensions directory
   cp -r mirror@distro.com ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/
   ```
   *Note: Remember to restart GNOME Shell and enable the extension via the "Extensions" app.*

## Must-know tips

 - **Wireless Debugging:** If your device is on the same Wi-Fi network and has Wireless Debugging enabled, Mirror will automatically find it using Avahi. Just click it in the list, and the extension will handle the `adb connect` pairing process for you.
 - **Closing the Stream:** You can close the active `scrcpy` window, or simply click the active Mirror toggle in Quick Settings to force-exit the process.

## Usage examples

Unlike the CLI version, Mirror manages options through a graphical interface in your system menu. 

 - **Basic Mirroring:** Open your GNOME Quick Settings (top right corner), click the "Mirror" toggle, and select your connected device.
 - **Offline/Unauthorized Devices:** The menu will visibly label devices that are visible but "Offline" or "Unauthorized." If a device is unauthorized, you must accept the RSA key prompt on your Android device's screen first.

## Contact

You can open an [issue] for bug reports, feature requests, or general questions regarding the GNOME extension.

If you are experiencing a core mirroring bug or an `adb` connection bug, please verify if the issue happens when running `scrcpy` or `adb` directly from the terminal. If it does, please report it to the respective upstream repositories.
